ONLY USE RELOAD_COGS TO CHANGE SHIT WHEN THE BOT IS RUNNING
ONLY TERMINATE BOT THROUGH COMMAND

REDO THE ENVIRONMENT AND REQUIREMENTS

# HARD

* use scheduling bot to select roles instead of other bots
* Create member and evaluator classes in each file as needed
* organize the code into functions

* Combine same language courses in the same embed
* add more robusts checks and remove default !help message
* find a way to not need to take guild in as a paremeter

# EASY

* update the server to reflect how the bot actually works
* make the first announcement channel an actual announcement channel
* show EST times everywhere
* way to send dms to all evaluators

STOP USING bot.guilds
